# Model discovery roots (required)
# Semicolon-separated directories. Only these directories are scanned for subfolders
# containing heads.pt. Each such subfolder becomes a model profile.
# Example:
# MODEL_DIRS=models;D:/AI/arabic-itsm-classification/models
MODEL_DIRS=models

# Optional default model id for /classify (must exist in discovered profiles)
# If unset, the first model in MODEL_DIRS (alphabetically) is used.
# DEFAULT_MODEL_ID=marbert_l2_best

# Optional: force device
# DEVICE=cpu

# ── Multi-task production model (optional shortcut) ──────────────────────────
# After running kaggle_train_multitask_arabic_itsm_classification on Kaggle
# and copying the checkpoint locally, set MULTITASK_MODEL_PATH to register it
# directly without needing it inside a MODEL_DIRS folder.
#
# MULTITASK_MODEL_PATH=models/marbert_multi_task_best
#
# The multi-task checkpoint has 5 heads (l1, l2, l3, priority, sentiment)
# in a single 621 MB forward pass — the production model.
